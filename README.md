## **Who Is Behind AI Traffic Accelerator?**

Neil Napier and Chris Munch—experienced marketers who’ve built multiple 6-figure businesses using AI.

They’ve tested this system for over a year before launching it.

## **Why Should You Listen to Me?**

A few months ago, I was stuck.

I had some tools. Some knowledge. I even built a few AI workflows on my own. But the traffic? It was random. One day I’d get a few clicks. The next day—nothing. I tried all the usual stuff—shorts, SEO, posting on forums. Still, no real traction.

I felt like I was doing everything and getting nowhere.

Then I tried AI Traffic Accelerator.

At first, I thought it might be like the others—more theory than action. But I followed the steps, one day at a time.

By Day 3, I had a real AI system up and running. It pulled traffic from places I’d never even considered before. A few days later, my old posts started getting views again. Not viral traffic or anything—but real, steady clicks from people who cared.

After two weeks, I saw a 40% jump in my daily traffic.

No paid ads. No content grind. No burnout.

It felt good to finally see something work—and to know **why** it was working.

Now I’m using the same setup on two more sites. It’s still running. Still bringing in traffic. And I’ve got time to focus on other parts of my business.

So yeah—I don’t just recommend it because it sounds good.

I recommend it because I’ve used it. I’ve seen the results. And if you stick with it, you probably will too.

## **AI Traffic Accelerator Bonuses**

As always, with any product I recommend, I’ve put together some custom bonuses to help you get the best from this course.

### Bonus #1: $110k in 5 Months Automation Formula ($397.00 FREE)

We have done $110k+ in automated sales of our own and partner products since April 2021 (5 months). Here's what I mean: Every time we get a new lead, we move them to an automation campaign (that runs for anywhere between 30 and 120 days - depending on what they have previously bought from us!). This runs in parallel to the email promotions, and product launches. So far, we have pushed through close to 20k leads through the system, with 1,000 new leads going through this every month. In this training I uncover the EXACT automation sequence responsible for bringing in $110k over the last 5 months, this is something I have never made public.
